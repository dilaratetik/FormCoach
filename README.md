# FormCoach 🏋️‍♂️🤖

FormCoach is an AI-powered fitness assistant that analyzes human movements **in real time** using **Computer Vision** and provides **instant corrective feedback** to ensure safe and effective exercise execution.

It is designed as an **accessible, affordable, and intelligent alternative** to personal trainers, helping users improve their form, prevent injuries, and track workout performance — all using just a **webcam**.

* ✅ Real-time posture and form correction
* ✅ Instant visual feedback
* ✅ Exercise validation (only correct reps count)
* ✅ Cost-free, self-training support
* ✅ Fully local processing (privacy-first)

## 🎯 Purpose & Objectives

The main goal of FormCoach is to:

* Analyze body movements in real time using computer vision
* Detect incorrect posture and risky movements
* Provide immediate feedback to correct form
* Track repetitions, calories burned, and form quality
* Make safe fitness training accessible to everyone
